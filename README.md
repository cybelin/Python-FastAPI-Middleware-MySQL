# Python-FastAPI-Middleware-MySQL
Protect your API with a logging middleware to capture HTTP requests and responses and block malicious IPs. Download it for free on GitHub for ASP.NET and Python (JavaScript and Java coming in December). Also on GitHub, Cybeline Monitor analyzes logs in SQL Server/MySQL, detects irregularities, and manages malicious IPs. Send me an email to alvaro@cybelin.com if you have any problem or you are interested in any collaboration.
